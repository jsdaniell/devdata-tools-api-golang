## DevDataTools API in Golang!

This is the back-end of devdata.tools application, that I developed for integrate database operations using firestore as database. You can find the front-end application here.

#### About

I use Mux for routing and all the application is created thinking in MVC pattern, there's a particularity on the groups controllers, because they can be used for any type of JSON object that can be grouped, in this way is more easy develop new modules for the application.
